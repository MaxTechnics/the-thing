A school bachelor class, we recorded a music video for the band Monokimono, and their (at that time) upcoming single 'Makkelijk Makkelijk'
I assisted electrically during filming, and did the color grading in DaVinci Resolve

It was my first experience color grading a music video, and I had a really hard time. However it was a good learning experience.

(_Don't ask me to color grade your music video though if you don't want to be disappointed_)
