In August 2022, the r/JaidenAnimations Discord server organized an art contest, the winning submission was decided by the members trough this web app.

This was my first project that used user input and Supabase, as well as mobile device suppoort. It was an incredible learning experience. Though the code was not pretty.

In August 2024 this project was reused for another art contest.

It worked well both times.
