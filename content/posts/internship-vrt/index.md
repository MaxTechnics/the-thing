## VRT

![Alt text](image.png)
The VRT is a great place to learn anything about broadcast, it has a very rich history, and I got to meet a bunch of cool people.

## Internship

For a little over 2 months I was intern audio as I wanted to learn more about it. If I were to get an internship again, I'd love to follow some technical heads.
